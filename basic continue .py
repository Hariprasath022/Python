[print(int("56bags"))]Error
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '56bags' on line 5
Description
A ValueError most often occurs when you pass a parameter to a function and the function is expecting one type and you pass another.

To Fix
The error message gives you a pretty good hint about the name of the function as well as the value that is incorrect. Look at the error message closely and then trace back to the variable containing the problematic value.
